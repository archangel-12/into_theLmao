### A sort of Information...

### So what is this?
This is the source code for the presentation slides that have been used during teaching sessions. I realize that it might not be suitable for high school standards, but this is the way I prefer when creating slides

### Where does is this came from?
All of the slides are generated using [Animotion](https://animotion.pages.dev/), with all scripts written in [Svelte](https://animotion.pages.dev/). By default, Animotion is a presentation framework based on [reveal.js](reveal.js) but with a Svelte flavor. I hope that clarifies things

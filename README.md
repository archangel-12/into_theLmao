### <div align="center">a sort of an explanation</div>

### so what is this?
this is the source code for the presentation slides that have been used during teaching sessions. i realize that it might not be suitable for high school standards, but this is the way i prefer when creating slides

### where does is this came from?
all of the slides are generated from [animotion](https://animotion.pages.dev/), with all scripts written in [svelte](https://svelte.dev/). by default, animotion is a presentation framework based on [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) but with a svelte flavor. i hope that clarifies things...
